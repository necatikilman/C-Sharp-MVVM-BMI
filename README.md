# C-Sharp-MVVM-BMI-Calculator
A simple WPF application that is built using MVVM architecture in .NET Framework.

This application helps you to calculate your BMI value and gives you an idea about the result by colouring the window's background.
There are two input fields that the user is supposed to fill in: weight (in kg) and height (in m). E.g.: 80 kg, 1.83 m. 
The BMI value will be calculated and displayed on the screen and the screen gets coloured based on the result.
